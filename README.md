# Background and Overview

JavaSip is a yelp clone inspired by our love for finding great tasting coffee. Users will be able to search for nearyby coffee shops by any location and submit reviews for them. 

# Functionality and MVP

User auth: Sign up and log in
Buisness page: List descriptions of coffee shops, pictures, and 5 star rating scale 
Reviews/ratings: Logged in users can post reviews, view buisness reviews, and edit their own reviews.  
Search/filter: Users can search for coffee shops and filter based on categories 
Map: Display various coffee shops based on submitted location

# Technologies and Technical Challenges

## Architecture

JavaSip is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). The backend will be developed using MongoDB/Express while the frontend will use React/Node.js.

## Technical Challenges

Users will be able to display a map of coffee shops based on location using Google maps API, which will also render dynamically as the user changes location.
